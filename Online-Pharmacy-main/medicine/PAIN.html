                <h3>POWERGESIC GEL 30G</h3>
                <p>	Owergesic 2X Gel is a medicine applied topically to relieve pain. It works by first cooling the skin then warming it up. This cooling and warming up action improves blood circulation and distracts the patient from pain. It also blocks the release of certain chemical messengers that cause pain and swelling.

                    Powergesic 2X Gel is only meant for external use and should be used strictly as advised by your doctor. A thin layer of the medicine should be rubbed into the affected areas with clean and dry hands. Avoid getting in contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth and avoid applying it on wounded or damaged skin. In case of accidental contact, rinse it with plenty of cold water.
                    
                    Use of this medicine may cause common side effects such as burning or stinging sensation, irritation, itching, and redness at the site of application in some people. Usually, the side effects will slowly go away as your body gets used to it. If they are severe or do not go away, you should let your doctor know.
                    
                    Although medicines used on the skin are not normally affected by other medicines, you should let your doctor know if you are taking any other medicine. You should also let your doctor know if you have any medical conditions or disorders to make sure it is safe for you. Ask your doctor for advice if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p>
